Food safety is a critical concern in the food industry, particularly with the increasing number of food-serving establishments and the potential risks of food-borne illnesses. This project, "Food Inspection Analysis using R," employs a data-driven approach to analyze and enhance food inspection practices. Through the analysis of three comprehensive datasets, we focus on different phases of food inspection, including initial food ratings, reports of adverse effects, and final inspection details.

Our analysis includes preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and statistical tests to improve food safety practices and public awareness. By informing stakeholders, policymakers, and the public about food safety issues, we aim to contribute to evidence-based decision-making in the food industry. This project addresses the challenges faced by government organizations in supervising compliance with food safety codes and emphasizes the importance of data analytics in supporting effective food safety practices and public health.
